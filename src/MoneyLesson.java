			+ "services for people, which is called bartering. However, it is not always possible to get "
			+ "what you want in this system. "
			+ "\n\n"
			+ "For example, if you have potatoes and you want a cow, you must find somebody who has "
			+ "meat and also wants potatoes. What if someone you meet wants potatoes but can only offer "
			+ "you strawberries? It doesn’t work out. "
			+ "\n\n"
			+ "Money sorts this problem out. Money, like a dollar bill, holds value to everyone. If "
			+ "a person wants a cow, they don’t have to find a person who will trade for their potatoes. "
			+ "Instead, they can sell their potatoes to someone with money at an agreed upon price. With "
			+ "the money they just received, they can then buy as much of a cow as the cow seller will "
			+ "give them. "
